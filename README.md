# PathogenPeril
This Repo is the main source code for my honours project, presently named 'Pathogen Peril'.
Here you can find all the classes and assets I've created to make this passion project a reality.

This project encompasses a 2D tactical turn-based strategy game involving the Immune System. 
The main goal is to simulate the behaviour of the immune systems response to various pathogens
via entertaining game mechanics, from the perspective of the invaders (Pathogens).
