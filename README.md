# COMP3000 - Honour's Project

<b>Supervisor - Dr Swen Gaudl</b>\
I'd like to wish a special thanks to my supervisor and all the people around me who gave me the motivation to make this project a reality.

## Project Vision

This product is for gaming enthusiasts with an interest in biology.
It is simply a fun game with added educational tidbits, for people interested in learning
while they play. It is a Video Game titled Pathogen Peril. The key benefits are that it mainly
focusses on educating people on how pathogens can negatively affect the body in a fun and
interesting (through its mechanics) way, making it great for students that struggle with
reading. Since its main audience is gamers, it has a got a strategic bent with several choices
for the player to make per turn. It will be a game with a higher skill ceiling but with
mechanics that are easy to learn meaning that it can be played casually to educate but also
appeal to hardcore gamers who want to prove their skills. The player will take turns
controlling units and strategizing patterns of attack to defeat immune cells.

This game will be developed in Unity. All code will be stored in a GitHub repo.
It will be coded in C#. All the Models will be designed in Krita which is where all
animations will also be created.
The game will be a 2D strategy game with an isometric top-down perspective.

## Pathogen Peril - Description
This Repo is the main source code for my honours project, presently named 'Pathogen Peril'.
Here you can find all the classes and assets I've created to make this passion project a reality.

This project encompasses a 2D tactical turn-based strategy game involving the Immune System. 
The main goal is to simulate the behaviour of the immune systems response to various pathogens
via entertaining game mechanics, from the perspective of the invaders (Pathogens).
